        <div class='pageBox' id='consentBox'>
            <div class='consentInstr'>To conduct this experiment, we need to include this information sheet:</div>
            <div class='formArea'>
                <strong>CONSENT FORM</strong><br /><br />
                You are invited to participate in a research study on human vision, conducted by Hongjing Lu, PhD, of the Dept. of Psychology at UCLA. You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you have normal or corrected vision and are 18 years of age or older.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Purpose of Study</strong><br />
                The purpose of the study is to understand human perception and cognition.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Procedures Involved in Study</strong><br />
                If you agree to participate, you may receive a demographic questionnaire to collect information of your age, gender, and language. You may be presented with video animations including multiple moving geometric shapes on a computer screen, and answer simple questions and/or perform simple tasks by interacting with a website via a keyboard or a computer mouse. Your responses will be recorded by the computer and will not be identified with you in any way. The session will take less than 60 minutes.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Potential Risks and Discomforts</strong><br />
                There is no known risk/discomfort in this study. If you experience any discomfort during the experiment, you can stop at any time and notify the experimenter.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Potential Benefits to Subject</strong><br />
                There are no direct benefits from participating in this study.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Potential Benefits to Society</strong><br />
                The findings of the study will help us understand how humans perceive and understand dynamics from visual inputs. By understanding the processes underlying human perception, we will be able to design better machine vision systems.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Payment for Participation</strong><br />
                You will receive 1 hour of credit for your psychology class if you signed up for the study through the UCLA Psychology Department Subject Pool; otherwise you will receive the payment in the rate of $10 per hour for your participation.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Alternatives to Participation</strong><br />
                An alternative to participating in this project and fulfilling Psychology 10 requirements is to participate in other research or to do an equivalent classroom project.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Confidentiality</strong><br />
                Your identity in this study will be treated as confidential. The results of the study, including laboratory or any other data, may be published for scientific purposes but will not include any identifiable references to you. Your data, including de-identified data, may be kept for use in future research.
                <br /><br />
                The researchers will do their best to make sure that your private information is kept confidential. Information about you will be handled as confidentially as possible, but participating in research may involve a loss of privacy and the potential for a breach in confidentiality. Study data will be physically and electronically secured.  As with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Participation and Withdraw</strong><br />
                Your participation is VOLUNTARY. You may withdraw from the experiment at any time without suffering any negative consequences. You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Identification of Investigators</strong><br />
                If you have any questions, feel free to contact Dr. Hongjing Lu (hongjing@ucla.edu), at the Department of Psychology, UCLA, 405 Hilgard Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Rights of Research Subjects</strong><br />
                You may withdraw your consent at any time and discontinue participation without penalty.  You are not waiving any legal claims, rights or remedies because of your participation in this research study.

            We are studying how humans perceive social interactions from the movements of simple shapes. We are testing it using a similarity judgment task. Two videos can be similar in multiple ways: the speed of the movements, the trajectory, the intention of each triangle, the relations between the two triangles, etc.<br /><br />
