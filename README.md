## HSvideo_v1
Odd One Out similarity test of selected 27 movies played at half speed.

## HSvideo_v2
Same design as in v1 except for an emphasis on social interactions in the instructions played at half speed.

## HSvideo_v3
Odd One Out similarity test of selected 27 movies played in reverse at half speed.

## HSvideo_v4
Odd One Out similarity test of selected 27 movies.

## HSvideo_v5
Odd One Out similarity test of selected 27 movies played in reverse.

## HSvideo_v6
Odd One Out similarity test of a different set of selected 27 movies. The prompt changed to "Which is the odd one out?"

## HSvideo_v7
Odd One Out similarity test of selected 27 movies, same in v4. The prompt changed to "Which is the odd one out?"

## ratingLabeling_short 
The first block is rating "To what extent are the two triangles socially interacting?" of selected 27 movies in v4. The second block is the labeling task of selected 27 movies in v4.

## ratingLabeling
